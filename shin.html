1. If X and Y are two sets such that n(X) = 17, n(Y) = 23 and n(X ‚à™ Y) = 38, find n(X ‚à© Y).

Solution:

Given

n (X) = 17

n (Y) = 23

n (X U Y) = 38

We can write it as

n (X U Y) = n (X) + n (Y) ‚Äì n (X ‚à© Y)

Substituting the values

38 = 17 + 23 ‚Äì n (X ‚à© Y)

By further calculation

n (X ‚à© Y) = 40 ‚Äì 38 = 2

So we get

n (X ‚à© Y) = 2

2. If X and Y are two sets such that X ‚à™Y has 18 elements, X has 8 elements and Y has 15 elements; how many elements does X ‚à© Y have?

Solution:

Given

n (X U Y) = 18

n (X) = 8

n (Y) = 15

We can write it as

n (X U Y) = n (X) + n (Y) ‚Äì n (X ‚à© Y)

Substituting the values

18 = 8 + 15 ‚Äì n (X ‚à© Y)

By further calculation

n (X ‚à© Y) = 23 ‚Äì 18 = 5

So we get

n (X ‚à© Y) = 5

3. In a group of 400 people, 250 can speak Hindi and 200 can speak English. How many people can speak both Hindi and English?

Solution:

Consider H as the set of people who speak Hindi

E as the set of people who speak English

We know that

n(H ‚à™ E) = 400

n(H) = 250

n(E) = 200

It can be written as

n(H ‚à™ E) = n(H) + n(E) ‚Äì n(H ‚à© E)

By substituting the values

400 = 250 + 200 ‚Äì n(H ‚à© E)

By further calculation

400 = 450 ‚Äì n(H ‚à© E)

So we get

n(H ‚à© E) = 450 ‚Äì 400

n(H ‚à© E) = 50

Therefore, 50 people can speak both Hindi and English.

4. If S and T are two sets such that S has 21 elements, T has 32 elements, and S ‚à© T has 11 elements, how many elements does S ‚à™ T have?

Solution:

We know that

n(S) = 21

n(T) = 32

n(S ‚à© T) = 11

It can be written as

n (S ‚à™ T) = n (S) + n (T) ‚Äì n (S ‚à© T)

Substituting the values

n (S ‚à™ T) = 21 + 32 ‚Äì 11

So we get

n (S ‚à™ T)= 42

Therefore, the set (S ‚à™ T) has 42 elements.

5. If X and Y are two sets such that X has 40 elements, X ‚à™Y has 60 elements and X ‚à©Y has 10 elements, how many elements does Y have?

Solution:

We know that

n(X) = 40

n(X ‚à™ Y) = 60

n(X ‚à© Y) = 10

It can be written as

n(X ‚à™ Y) = n(X) + n(Y) ‚Äì n(X ‚à© Y)

By substituting the values

60 = 40 + n(Y) ‚Äì 10

On further calculation

n(Y) = 60 ‚Äì (40 ‚Äì 10) = 30

Therefore, the set Y has 30 elements.

6. In a group of 70 people, 37 like coffee, 52 like tea, and each person likes at least one of the two drinks. How many people like both coffee and tea?

Solution:

Consider C as the set of people who like coffee

T as the set of people who like tea

n(C ‚à™ T) = 70

n(C) = 37

n(T) = 52

It is given that

n(C ‚à™ T) = n(C) + n(T) ‚Äì n(C ‚à© T)

Substituting the values

70 = 37 + 52 ‚Äì n(C ‚à© T)

By further calculation

70 = 89 ‚Äì n(C ‚à© T)

So we get

n(C ‚à© T) = 89 ‚Äì 70 = 19

Therefore, 19 people like both coffee and tea.

7. In a group of 65 people, 40 like cricket, 10 like both cricket and tennis. How many like tennis only and not cricket? How many like tennis?

Solution:

Consider C as the set of people who like cricket

T as the set of people who like tennis

n(C ‚à™ T) = 65

n(C) = 40

n(C ‚à© T) = 10

It can be written as

n(C ‚à™ T) = n(C) + n(T) ‚Äì n(C ‚à© T)

Substituting the values

65 = 40 + n(T) ‚Äì 10

By further calculation

65 = 30 + n(T)

So we get

n(T) = 65 ‚Äì 30 = 35

Hence, 35 people like tennis.

We know that,

(T ‚Äì C) ‚à™ (T ‚à© C) = T

So we get,

(T ‚Äì C) ‚à© (T ‚à© C) = Œ¶

Here

n (T) = n (T ‚Äì C) + n (T ‚à© C)

Substituting the values

35 = n (T ‚Äì C) + 10

By further calculation

n (T ‚Äì C) = 35 ‚Äì 10 = 25

Therefore, 25 people like only tennis.

8. In a committee, 50 people speak French, 20 speak Spanish and 10 speak both Spanish and French. How many speak at least one of these two languages?

Solution:

Consider F as the set of people in the committee who speak French

S as the set of people in the committee who speak Spanish

n(F) = 50

n(S) = 20

n(S ‚à© F) = 10

It can be written as

n(S ‚à™ F) = n(S) + n(F) ‚Äì n(S ‚à© F)

By substituting the values

n(S ‚à™ F) = 20 + 50 ‚Äì 10

By further calculation

n(S ‚à™ F) = 70 ‚Äì 10

n(S ‚à™ F) = 60

Therefore, 60 people in the committee speak at least one of the two languages.

‚à¥A ‚äÇ (A ‚à© B) ‚à™ (A ‚Äì B) (i)

It can be concluded that, A ‚à© B ‚äÇ A and (A ‚Äì B) ‚äÇ A

Thus, (A ‚à© B) ‚à™ (A ‚Äì B) ‚äÇ A (ii)

Equating (i) and (ii),

And, C = {0, 4, 5}

According to the question,

A ‚à© B = {0}

And,

A ‚à© C = {0}

‚à¥ A ‚à© B = A ‚à© C = {0}

But,

11. Let A and B be sets. If A ‚à© X = B ‚à© X = œï and A ‚à™ X = B ‚à™ X for some set X, show that A = B.
(Hints A = A ‚à© (A ‚à™ X) , B = B ‚à© (B ‚à™ X) and use Distributive law)

Solution:

According to the question,

Let A and B be two sets such that A ‚à© X = B ‚à© X = œï and A ‚à™ X = B ‚à™ X for some set X.

To show, A = B

Proof:

A = A ‚à© (A ‚à™ X) = A ‚à© (B ‚à™ X) [A ‚à™ X = B ‚à™ X]

= (A ‚à© B) ‚à™ (A ‚à© X) [Distributive law]

= (A ‚à© B) ‚à™ Œ¶ [A ‚à© X = Œ¶]

= A ‚à© B (i)

Now, B = B ‚à© (B ‚à™ X)

= B ‚à© (A ‚à™ X) [A ‚à™ X = B ‚à™ X]

= (B ‚à© A) ‚à™ (B ‚à© X) ‚Ä¶ [Distributive law]

= (B ‚à© A) ‚à™ Œ¶ [B ‚à© X = Œ¶]

= A ‚à© B (i)

Hence, from equations (i) and (ii), we obtain A = B.

12. Find sets A, B and C such that A ‚à© B, B ‚à© C and A ‚à© C are non-empty sets and A ‚à© B ‚à© C = Œ¶.
Solution:

According to the question,

A ‚à© B = {1}

B ‚à© C = {2}

And,

A ‚à© C = {0}

‚à¥ A ‚à© B, B ‚à© C and A ‚à© C are not empty sets

Hence, we get,

13. In a survey of 600 students in a school, 150 students were found to be taking tea and 225 taking coffee, 100 were taking both tea and coffee. Find how many students were taking neither tea nor coffee.

Solution:

Let us assume that,

U = the set of all students who took part in the survey

T = the set of students taking tea

C = the set of the students taking coffee

Total number of students in a school, n (U) = 600

Number of students taking tea, n (T) = 150

Number of students taking coffee, n (C) = 225

Also, n (T ‚à© C) = 100

Now, we have to find that number of students taking neither coffee nor tea i.e. n (T ‚à© C‚Äô)

‚à¥ According to the question,

n ( T ‚à© C‚Äô )= n( T ‚à© C )‚Äô

= n (U) ‚Äì n (T ‚à© C)

= n (U) ‚Äì [n (T) + n(C) ‚Äì n (T ‚à© C)]

= 600 ‚Äì [150 + 225 ‚Äì 100]

= 600 ‚Äì 275

= 325

‚à¥ Number of students taking neither coffee nor tea = 325 students

14. In a group of students, 100 students know Hindi, 50 know English and 25 know both. Each of the students knows either Hindi or English. How many students are there in the group?

Solution:

Let us assume that,

U = the set of all students in the group

E = the set of students who know English

H = the set of the students who know Hindi

‚à¥ H ‚à™ E = U

Given that,

Number of students who know Hindi n (H) = 100

Number of students who knew English, n (E) = 50

Number of students who know both, n (H ‚à© E) = 25

We have to find the total number of students in the group i.e. n (U)

‚à¥ According to the question,

n (U) = n(H) + n(E) ‚Äì n(H ‚à© E)

= 100 + 50 ‚Äì 25

= 125

‚à¥ Total number of students in the group = 125 students

15. In a survey of 60 people, it was found that 25 people read newspaper H, 26 read newspaper T, 26 read newspaper I, 9 read both H and I, 11 read both H and T, 8 read both T and I, 3 read all three newspapers. Find:

(i) The number of people who read at least one of the newspapers.
(ii) The number of people who read exactly one newspaper.

Solution:

(i) Let us assume that,

A = the set of people who read newspaper H

B = the set of people who read newspaper T

C = the set of people who read newspaper I

According to the question,

Number of people who read newspaper H, n (A) = 25

Number of people who read newspaper T, n (B) = 26

Number of people who read the newspaper I, n (C) = 26

Number of people who read both newspaper H and I, n (A ‚à© C) = 9

Number of people who read both newspaper H and T, n (A ‚à© B) = 11

Number of people who read both newspaper T and I, n (B ‚à© C) = 8

And, Number of people who read all three newspaper H, T and I, n (A ‚à© B ‚à© C) = 3

Now, we have to find the number of people who read at least one of the newspaper

‚à¥, we get.

= 25 + 26 + 26 ‚Äì 11 ‚Äì 8 ‚Äì 9 + 3

= 80 ‚Äì 28

= 52

‚à¥ There are a total of 52 students who read at least one newspaper.

(ii) Let us assume that,

a = the number of people who read newspapers H and T only

b = the number of people who read newspapers I and H only

c = the number of people who read newspapers T and I only

d = the number of people who read all three newspapers

According to the question,

D = n(A ‚à© B ‚à© C) = 3

Now, we have:

n(A ‚à© B) = a + d

n(B ‚à© C) = c + d

And,

n(C ‚à© A) = b + d

‚à¥ a + d + c +d + b + d = 11 + 8 + 9

a + b + c + d = 28 ‚Äì 2d

= 28 ‚Äì 6

= 22

‚à¥ Number of people read exactly one newspaper = 52 ‚Äì 22

= 30 people

16. In a survey it was found that 21 people liked product A, 26 liked product B and 29 liked product C. If 14 people liked products A and B, 12 people liked products C and A, 14 people liked products B and C and 8 liked all the three products. Find how many liked product C only.

Solution:

Let A, B and C = the set of people who like product A, product B and product C respectively.

Now, according to the question,

Number of students who like product A, n (A) = 21

Number of students who like product B, n (B) = 26

Number of students who like product C, n (C) = 29

Number of students who like both products A and B, n (A ‚à© B) = 14

Number of students who like both products A and C, n(C ‚à© A) = 12

Number of students who like both product C and B, n (B ‚à© C) = 14

Number of students who like all three product, n (A ‚à© B ‚à© C) = 8

Number of students who only like product C = {29 ‚Äì (4 + 8 + 6)}

= {29 ‚Äì 18}

= 11 students
